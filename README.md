# Autodark Plugin for Oh My Zsh

This plugin can be used to automatically switch between light and dark mode. It
runs [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) (by default,
`tomorrow` and `tomorrow-night-eighties`).

## Installation

Just clone this repo into your Oh My Zsh `custom/plugins` folder, and add it to
your `.zshrc`:

```
plugins=(<...other> autodark)
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make the command customizable
- [ ] Write scripts for bash, fish, etc
